# Project 2 - *FLIX*

**FLIX** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **22** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X ] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X ] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [ X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Adding option for users to create an account on the app
2. Adding an area for people to leave comments

## Notes

Challenges:

Coding in Objective-C without much knowledge of syntax is pretty tough. Dealing with tedious placement in Xcode Main Storyboard.
